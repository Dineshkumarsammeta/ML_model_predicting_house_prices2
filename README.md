# Project Title
*Machine Learning Model for Predicting House Prices in the UK*

## 📅 Project Timeline
**Duration:** 10-Jan-2023 – 12-March-2023  
**Location:** Master's in Advanced Computer Science, UK  
**Employer Name:** Self-initiated Academic Project  
**Reporting to:** Furqan Aziz  
**Type of Project:** Big Data (Academic Project)  

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this project was to build a **data-driven house price forecasting system** that provides accurate property valuation insights across more than 15 UK locations.  

By leveraging advanced ML models, data pipelines, and geospatial integration, the project aimed to help investors, estate agents, and mortgage brokers make informed decisions and identify high-growth investment zones.

## 🏠 Background & Relevance
House price forecasting is a critical area for real estate, mortgage, and PropTech industries.  
This project integrates **housing market data, geospatial factors (schools, transport, amenities), and advanced ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost)** to improve predictive accuracy and deliver actionable insights.  

The outcome was a scalable, ethical, and real-time system for UK housing market analysis.

## ⚙️ Methodology
- Gathered **25,000+ housing data points** from open APIs and Kaggle datasets.  
- Cleaned and standardized property records using **Python (Pandas, NumPy)**.  
- Integrated **geospatial data** for contextual features (schools, transport, amenities).  
- Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with Matplotlib and Seaborn.  
- Built and tuned ML models (**Random Forest, XGBoost**) using hyperparameter optimization.  
- Performed **cross-validation** and evaluation with R² and RMSE.  
- Automated repetitive analysis tasks for efficiency.  
- Developed **dashboards and visual reports** to present regional insights.

## 📌 Project Responsibilities
- Collected, merged, and standardized **25,000+ housing data points** across 15+ UK regions.  
- Developed **cleaning and preprocessing pipelines** using Pandas/NumPy.  
- Integrated **geospatial data** for location-based attributes (schools, transit, amenities).  
- Conducted **EDA** to explore price factors and trends.  
- Built, trained, and optimized **Random Forest & XGBoost regression models**.  
- Applied **hyperparameter tuning** to improve accuracy and reduce RMSE.  
- Validated models with **cross-validation & standard performance metrics**.  
- Designed **visual dashboards & reports** for investors and estate agents.  
- Automated repetitive preprocessing tasks to save analyst time.  
- Documented the full pipeline for **scalability and repeatability**.  
- Collaborated with peers for validation and conducted peer assessments.  
- Ensured **data ethics & compliance** with public datasets.  
- Presented findings to **academic and professional audiences**.  

## 📊 Results & Achievements
- Achieved **~90% R² score** with ensemble ML models.  
- Identified **key growth zones** with up to **15% annual appreciation** potential.  
- Reduced manual market analysis time by **30+ hours per analyst/month** through automation.  
- Produced insights that informed **real estate investment & portfolio planning**.  
- Developed a **scalable proof-of-concept**, adaptable to different housing markets in the UK.
